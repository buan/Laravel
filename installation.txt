So I will be developing the laravel app on ubuntu 16.04.
Installation steps:
a)Go to the terminal and the location where you want this to be installed.I am installing in  data/html

b)Open terminal and install composer.Paste this.
php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin --filename=composer

Link is given below:
https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx


c)Once you install composer,paste this
composer create-project laravel/laravel lsapp

It will take sometime and install laravel.Now go to localhost/lsapp/public.You may get this message
"Whoops, looks like something went wrong.". Dont worry.

d)Follow these instructions.
1)Rename .env.example to .env

2)Go to terminal and run this command php
php artisan key:generate


e)now run localhost/lsapp/public. and problem is solved


Overview of folder structure of Laravel
1)app folder=All the models will be under app folder.By default we have user.php

2)Controllers are there in app/http/controllers/controller.php(default).You can create a controller manually..but we will use artisan..as it will include automatically the classes and dependecies

3)There is an auth folder where items based on authentication items like login,register etc

4)Views are there in app/resource/views.By default,there is welcome.blade.php.We use blade template engine

5)Routes=We have routes folder.Inside routes folder,we will get routes defined.For eg, in web.php

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

6) change db connections.
.env file
