SO here we create another controller
PostsController.php

We use the same command
php artisan make:controller PostsController

A file called PostsController.php at app/Http/Controllers


We will create a model called PostsController
php artisan make:model Posts -m

Here the -m denotes migrations. 

Posts.php created under app folder
and under migrations we will have

2018_05_05_203834_create_posts_table.php created

Under migrations we have 2 functions up and down

up
======
public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    This means that when we will run db migrate it will create a table called posts with columns id and 2timestamps(created at and updated at).Besides this we can add more columns to our model
