For basic routes,go to routes/web.php

You will see that already a default route is there

1)Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

This means when you set url to slash(/),it will load a view page,whose name is welcome 

You can return normal text also


2)Route::get('/hello', function () {
    return "helloworld";
});

/hello means it will print hello world

3)Route::get('/hello', function () {
    return "<h1>helloworld</h1>";
});
You can load html also

4)Route::get('/about', function () {
    return view('pages/about');
});
You can load another view.Create a about.blade.php under folder "pages".This page wil get loaded.
